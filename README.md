# [What factors affect employment after bootcamp completion?](https://www.kaggle.com/chessybo/bootcamp-success-vs-age)

Do you use any free "learn to code" [website](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/we-just-launched-the-biggest-ever-survey-of-people-learning-to-code-cac81dadf1ea) to teach yourself programming? Clay used publicly available [survey data](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey) taken by [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), to understand the demographic of self-taught coders.

## Data Analysis Insights
- an awnser to [issue #6](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey/issues/36), "What factors affect employment after bootcamp completion?"
- how post bootcamp employment status after coding bootcamp affects whether a participant will reccomend doing a coding bootcamp.
- how does attending coding events correlate with employment status?


I demonstrate that older applicants are decreasingly likely to get a job after bootcamp. Looking for factors that correlate with no job after bootcamp. These factors should increase with age so we can discern causality.
