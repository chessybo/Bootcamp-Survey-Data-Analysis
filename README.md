Do you use any free "learn to code" website to teach yourself programming? Clay used publicly available [survey data](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey) taken by [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), to understand the demographic of self-taught coders.

## Data Analysis Insights
- an awnser to [issue #6](ttps://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey/issues/36), "What factors affect employment after bootcamp completion?"
- how post bootcamp employment status after coding bootcamp affects whether a participant will reccomend doing a coding bootcamp.
- how does attending coding events correlate with employment status?
<h2> About the Data </h2>

The survey was conducted anonymously and published on the web and promoted via social media from March 28 through May 2, 2016, targeting people who are relatively new to programming.

I demonstrate that older applicants are decreasingly likely to get a job after bootcamp. Looking for factors that correlate with no job after bootcamp. These factors should increase with age so we can discern causality.
